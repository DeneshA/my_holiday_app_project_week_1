# Third-party API's  : Nager Date API, Abstract API , WeatherAPI
The Holiday App (HA) is built to interact with Abstract APIs, Nager Date API, and Weather API to enable the functionality of our HA. It operates under the 'Free Plan,' as this development serves an educational purpose. However, it has a limitation, allowing either 1 request per second or a total of 1,000 requests. This poses a significant challenge for the project as it continues to grow. Nager Date API has a wide range of scope to access additional data and additional endpoints.

# Overview
Traveling is fun, but it can turn upside down if you lack proper planning, potentially ruining your travel experience. The Holiday App  is aimed at building a solution for those fun-loving travelers to efficiently manage their precious time and enjoy their time with loved ones.

# Key Functionalities

• Users are able to search for events based on Location, Year, Month & Date.
      ----• Users are able to search for country profile information
      ----• Users are able to search for Upcomming events information based on year
      ----• Users are able to search for events and customize the searchs using date,Month, and year
      
• Users can check the events for a given period (Optional)

• Users can check the forecast for the present day based on their location. (Optinal)

• Users can find the current currency rate for the day based on location. (Optional)

• Users can use the Holiday App on mobile, tablet, laptop, and PC.

# Potential Challenges

• To enhance the functionality of this HA, we plan to widen the scope so that a user can make a request for a given date range. However, there is a drawback from the Free plan, as an API request can only be made for a certain day and not for a range of periods.

• This build is aimed at interacting with different third-party APIs; therefore, unknown errors might arise.
