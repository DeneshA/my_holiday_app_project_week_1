# Holiday App 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Repository : my_holiday_app_project_week_1
This is a Holiday App (HA) project for my portfolio, showcasing my JavaScript skills and demonstrating how to handle third-party APIs

# Third-party API's  : Abstract API ,WeatherAPI
The Holiday App (HA) is built to interact with Abstract APIs, and Weather API to enable the functionality of our HA. It operates under the 'Free Plan,' as this development serves an educational purpose. However, it has a limitation, allowing either 1 request per second or a total of 1,000 requests. This poses a significant challenge for the project as it continues to grow.

# Overview
Traveling is fun, but it can turn upside down if you lack proper planning, potentially ruining your travel experience. The Holiday App  is aimed at building a solution for those fun-loving travelers to efficiently manage their precious time and enjoy their time with loved ones.

# Key Functionalities

• Users are able to search for events based on Location, Year, Month & Date.

• Users can check the events for a given period (Optional)

• Users can check the forecast for the present day based on their location.

• Users can find the current currency rate for the day based on location.

• Users can use the Holiday App on mobile, tablet, laptop, and PC.

# Potential Challenges

• Limitation is a key challenge of the build as it states the Free Plan allows only 1 request per second, making multiple API calls during a single request.

• To enhance the functionality of this HA, we plan to widen the scope so that a user can make a request for a given date range. However, there is a drawback from the Free plan, as an API request can only be made for a certain day and not for a range of periods.

• This build is aimed at interacting with different third-party APIs; therefore, unknown errors might arise.

• As this application does not hold any database, we plan to store temporary data in a JSON file.

# Wireframe
The wireframe prototype showcases how the result will be at the end of the Holiday App development.
